# Footing and housing provisions including slabs and reinforcements

Footings (geotechnical engineering) history: 
  - [ ] 8000 BCE Aboriginal Aqua Engineering for Eel food farming cultivation in the South of Australia
  - [ ] 2000 BCE floor control, irrigation, burial sites in Egypt, Mesopotamia, Indus Valley and 
  - [ ] 10th Century Ancient Greece: post in ground, padstones or staddle stone and rubble trench foundations
  - [ ] 1717 Henri Gautier French Royal Engineer recognises "natural slope in soils" leading to the "angle of repose"
  - [ ] 1773 Charles Coulomb army captain designing military ramparts defines "slip plane angle" and "soil cohesion friction" aka Mohr-Coulomb theory.
  - [ ] 1868 France Reinforced concrete invested by Joseph Monier, France 1868
  - [ ] 1925 Karl Terzghi publishes Erdbaumechanik defining "effective stress" and "shear strength" leading to equations of poroelasticity.
